A [Giter8][g8] template for [Processing][processing] sketches in Scala!

This template includes a [direnv][d] config file (`.envrc`), as Processing 
requires Oracle JDK 8 to run on macOS. If this applies to you, double check that the 
`JAVA_HOME` set by the provided config points to the correct place and run `direnv allow` 
after instantiating a new project from the template.

To the extent possible under law, the author(s) have dedicated all copyright and related
